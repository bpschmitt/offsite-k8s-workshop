## 03. Troubleshooting

There are a few common commands used to begin the troubleshooting process for the majority of issues in a Kubernetes cluster.  Those commands are:

* `kubectl describe pod` (or other resources like `node`, `deployment`, etc)
* `kubectl logs pod`
* `kubectl get events`

### Describing Resources

Describing a Kubernetes resource (in this case, a pod) will output its current configuration as well as any related Kubernetes events.  This can be extremely useful in identifying why a pod might not be starting properly.

There are a few things of note here:

* The container state and reason (Waiting - CreateContainerConfigError)
* The conditions: `Ready: False` and `ContainersReady: False`
* The pod events, specifically `Error: secret "nrlicensekey" not found`

You've found the culprit.  A required secret is missing so the pod is unable to start successfully.  This happens to be the secret that contains your New Relic license key.  In the next step, you'll create it to resolve the issue.

```

### Create the Secret

Create the `nrlicensekey` secret using the command below.  The `logs-demo-*` pod should automatically start and the status should be `Running`.

Do you remember the command to list the pods in a namespace?

```
[~]$ kubectl create secret generic nrlicensekey --from-literal=nrlicensekey=<YOUR LICENSE KEY> -n demo
```

You can validate that the secret was created successfully with the following command:
```
[~]$ kubectl get secret nrlicensekey -n demo
NAME           TYPE     DATA   AGE
nrlicensekey   Opaque   1      153m

[~]$ kubectl describe secret nrlicensekey -n demo
Name:         nrlicensekey
Namespace:    demo
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

Type:  Opaque

Data
====
nrlicensekey:  40 bytes
```

### Events

Sometimes the root cause of a cranky deployment may not be completely obvious from the pod events and you'll need to take a broader look at the cluster events.  You can do this with the `kubectl get event` command.  Note that the example below is scoped to the `demo` namespace.
```
[~]$ k get events -n demo
LAST SEEN   TYPE      REASON              OBJECT                                          MESSAGE

### Logs

The `kubectl logs` command will show you the container logs for applications running in your pods.  Typically, this is also a great source of information when trying to troubleshoot a problem.  In this example, you'll look at the logs for the `crasher-*` pod and it will be very obvious what's wrong.

```
$ kubectl logs crasher-6f4bccdddd-7hnp8 -n demo
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./app.py", line 9, in <module>
    with open('Data.txt') as f:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'Data.txt'
```

If you describe that pod, take a closer look at the `Containers` section for more detail as to what's happening.  You'll see the container exit code is `1` because of the error above.  The container is not able to successfully start and the `restartPolicy` for the container is `Always`.  This means that Kubernetes will try to restart the container if it fails, which is why the restart count continues to go up.

```
$ k describe pod crasher-6f4bccdddd-7hnp8 -n demo
